# Medical-Insurance-SQL-Project
This project uses a medical insurance dataset (1,338 records) to practice SQL basics:
- Data cleaning
- Table restructuring
- Basic CRUD operations (Insert, Update, Delete)

## üîß What I Practiced

- Exploring data with `SELECT` and `COUNT`
- Checking and cleaning missing or invalid values
- Renaming columns
- Creating a table with an `id` column
- CRUD operations:
  - **INSERT**: add new data
  - **UPDATE**: correct data
  - **DELETE**: remove unwanted data

## üíª Example SQL Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Data
-- Show first 10 rows
SELECT * FROM insurance LIMIT 10;

-- Count total rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM insurance;

-- Check for NULL or empty values
SELECT *
FROM insurance
WHERE age IS NULL OR age = ''
   OR bmi IS NULL OR bmi = ''
   OR charges IS NULL OR charges = ''
   OR children IS NULL OR children = ''
   OR region IS NULL OR region = ''
   OR sex IS NULL OR sex = ''
   OR smoker IS NULL OR smoker = '';

###2Ô∏è‚É£ Rename Column 
-- Rename 'sex' column to 'gender'
ALTER TABLE insurance
RENAME COLUMN sex TO gender;

-- Verify change
SELECT gender FROM insurance;
